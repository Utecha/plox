# Lox - Python Edition

This is an implementation of the [Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) programming language, tree-walk interpreter version in Python.

This is basically a *slightly* modified version of both the original + what I wrote the first time I followed along in this book.

In fact, this one is the second implementation I did. Java was the first one.
